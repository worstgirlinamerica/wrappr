A fork of the Apple Music FPS (FairPlay Streaming) decryption wrapper, based on
[`glomatico/wrapper-v2`](https://github.com/glomatico/wrapper-v2), which adds two HTTP endpoints — `/webplayback` and `/license`.

The companion [gamdl-pr](https://github.com/worstgirlinamerica/gamdl/tree/playready) uses ```wrappr``` for PlayReady-based decryption.

## Development note

This project has been forked and developed with AI assistance. The code should be
treated as research-grade and reviewed carefully, especially in the case that [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) is unsuccessful. AI-generated changes
are not assumed to be correct just because they compile.

## Prerequisites

Before you do anything, make sure you have:

- **Docker** — how you get it depends on your platform (see below)
- **An Apple Music for Android APK or APKM** — version **3.6.0-beta build 1109**
  is the tested version. You need to source this yourself legally (e.g. from your
  own device via `adb pull`, or from an APK mirror you trust). This repo does
  not host or link to Apple binaries.
- **Git** — to clone this repo

That's it. The build itself runs entirely inside Docker — no Rust, Go, NDK, or C++ toolchain needed on your machine.

---

## Quick Start

Pick your platform:

### macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon)

macOS doesn't ship Docker. The easiest path is **Colima** (free, terminal-based) or **Docker Desktop** (GUI, free for personal use).

**Option A — Colima (recommended, lighter weight):**

```bash
# Install Homebrew first if you don't have it: https://brew.sh
brew install colima docker docker-compose
colima start --disk 20
```

**Option B — Docker Desktop:**

Download and install from [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Start it from your Applications folder before continuing.

---

Once Docker is running, clone and build:

```bash
git clone -b playready https://github.com/worstgirlinamerica/wrappr.git
cd wrappr
```

Stage the Android system binaries (committed to the repo, just needs copying into place):

```bash
bash tools/stage-system.sh --arch x86_64
```

> **Apple Silicon Mac?** Use `--arch arm64-v8a` instead. See the [arm64 section](#arm64-v8a-image-apple-silicon--aarch64-linux) below.

Extract your Apple Music APK libraries into the build (replace the path with wherever your APK is):

```bash
bash tools/extract-libs.sh --bundle /path/to/apple-music.apk --arch x86_64
```

Build and start:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1/health
curl http://127.0.0.1/me
```

A `"status":"ok"` and `"playback_ready":true` in the responses means you're good.

---

### Linux (x86_64)

Install Docker via your distro's package manager or from [docs.docker.com/engine/install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Then:

```bash
git clone -b playready https://github.com/worstgirlinamerica/wrappr.git
cd wrappr
bash tools/stage-system.sh --arch x86_64
bash tools/extract-libs.sh --bundle /path/to/apple-music.apk --arch x86_64
docker compose up --build -d
```

Verify:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1/health
curl http://127.0.0.1/me
```

---

### Windows

Windows isn't directly supported, but you can run this inside **WSL 2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with Docker Desktop's WSL integration enabled.

1. Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and enable WSL 2 backend in Settings.
2. Open a WSL 2 terminal (Ubuntu recommended).
3. Follow the Linux steps above inside that terminal.

---

## What it is

A small daemon that exposes a local HTTP API for account/playback control plus
a raw TCP port for FPS sample decryption, and gives downstream tooling (e.g.
[`gamdl`](https://github.com/worstgirlinamerica/gamdl)) a uniform interface that does
not depend on platform or language.

At runtime `/app/wrappr` is a host-Linux Rust supervisor. It owns the public
HTTP port, owns the raw decrypt TCP port, and starts `/app/wrapper`, the small
host chroot launcher. The launcher execs `/system/bin/main`, an Android/NDK C++
IPC worker inside the Linux chroot. Only that worker loads Apple Music's Android
native libraries. If FPS hangs, crashes, or returns a CKC/KD-style decrypt
error, the Rust supervisor can discard the worker while keeping the public
listeners alive.

The daemon ships _no_ Apple code. Apple Music native libraries must be supplied
by the person building the image and staged into `rootfs/system/lib64/`; the
expected `.so` SHA-256 digests are pinned in `LIBS_VERSION.json`.

---

## HTTP API

Most endpoints accept and return `application/json`. Decryption is not exposed
through HTTP; clients use the raw TCP decrypt protocol on
`${WRAPPER_DECRYPT_PORT:-10020}`.

| Method   | Path           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/health`      | Liveness probe. `{status, version, runtime}` — `runtime.playback_ready` is true when FPS decrypt is available.                                                                             |
| `GET`    | `/me`          | `{version, runtime, auth}` — same runtime flags as `/health`.                                                                                                                               |
| `POST`   | `/login`       | Body: `{"username": "...", "password": "..."}` or `{"apple_id": "...", "password": "..."}` (synonyms). Drives Apple's `AuthenticateFlow`. Returns `200` + token snapshot or `202` for 2FA. |
| `POST`   | `/login/2fa`   | Body: `{"code": "123456"}`. Continues a login waiting for HSA2.                                                                                                                             |
| `GET`    | `/playback`    | Query string `?adam_id=<numeric store id>`. Returns `200` with `{"songList":[...]}` containing the whole MZ playback dispatch Apple's `subDownload` URL returns.                            |
| `GET`    | `/webplayback` | Query string `?adamId=<numeric store id>`. Returns Apple's web playback response for the given store ID using the authenticated session. The response contains HLS playlist URLs.            |
| `POST`   | `/license`     | Relays a web playback license request to Apple. Body: `challenge` (base64), `uri`, `adamId`, and optional `drm-type` (`wv` for Widevine, `pr` for PlayReady; defaults to `pr`).             |
| `DELETE` | `/login`       | Aborts an in-flight login or clears cached tokens from memory. Apple's on-disk `mpl_db` cache is unchanged.                                                                                 |

## TCP Decrypt API

The decrypt listener defaults to `0.0.0.0:10020`. The Compose file maps this as
`${DECRYPT_PORT:-10020}:10020`. This branch uses wrappr's versioned batch
protocol; it is not wire-compatible with the original wrapper sample stream.

All integers are big-endian. Request and response frames share this envelope:

```text
magic        4 bytes  "WV2D"
version      u16      1
kind         u16      1 = decrypt batch, 2 = decrypt ok, 3 = decrypt error, 9 = close
request_id   u32
payload_len  u32
payload      payload_len bytes
```

Decrypt batch payload:

```text
adam_id_len
uri_len
sample_count
sample_len[0]
...
sample_len[sample_count - 1]
adam_id bytes
uri bytes
sample[0] bytes
...
sample[sample_count - 1] bytes
```

Successful decrypt payload:

```text
sample_count
sample_len[0]
...
sample_len[sample_count - 1]
sample[0] bytes
...
sample[sample_count - 1] bytes
```

Error payloads are UTF-8 messages. Decrypt errors, worker crashes, or worker
timeouts close the affected TCP client connection; the Rust supervisor starts a
fresh Apple worker for later requests.

Sign-in matches the legacy wrapper model: you send **email (Apple ID) and password**
to the daemon; it fills credentials through the native presentation interface.
With a persistent `WRAPPER_BASE_DIR` volume, Apple keeps `mpl_db/kvs.sqlitedb` on
disk. On each process start the daemon tries **session restore** (default
`WRAPPER_RESTORE_SESSION=1`): if that session is still valid, `GET /me` can show
**authenticated** and fresh tokens **without** another `POST /login`. Use
`POST /login` when the volume is new, restore fails, or you need to re-auth.
Optional `WRAPPER_APPLE_ID` only sets the `apple_id` label in `/me` after restore.

## Building

### One-time setup

You need a working Docker installation. Apart from that, the entire build
runs inside the image. There is no host toolchain prerequisite for the
default workflow.

For the build to succeed, `rootfs/system/lib64/` must already contain the
required Apple Music native libraries for your `TARGET_ARCH`. The tested source
version is Apple Music for Android **3.6.0-beta build 1109**. Provide your own
legally obtained `.apk` or `.apkm`; this repository does not host, link to, or
redistribute Apple binaries.

### Local build

#### 1. Extract Apple Music native libraries

Provide a local Apple Music `.apk` or `.apkm` for the target architecture. The
default output is `rootfs/system/lib64/`, and every extracted `.so` must match
the hashes in `LIBS_VERSION.json`.

```bash
bash tools/extract-libs.sh --bundle path/to/local/apple-music.apk --arch x86_64
```

`.apkm` bundles are also accepted:

```bash
bash tools/extract-libs.sh --bundle path/to/local/apple-music.apkm --arch x86_64
```

#### 2. Stage Android system binaries

This copies the committed Android linker and system libraries into `rootfs/`,
verifying their SHA-256 hashes against `LIBS_VERSION.json`.

```bash
bash tools/stage-system.sh --arch x86_64
```

#### 3. Build and run

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

#### 4. Smoke test

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1/health
curl http://127.0.0.1/me
```

The daemon binds HTTP port 80 and TCP decrypt port 10020 inside the container.
Override with `HTTP_PORT=8080` or `DECRYPT_PORT=11020` when those host ports are
already in use.

### Optional sign in

You do not need to sign in manually as part of the local build. Downstream tools
such as [`gamdl`](https://github.com/worstgirlinamerica/gamdl) can ask for credentials
automatically and call `/login` / `/login/2fa` when they need an authenticated
Apple Music session.

For manual testing, use your real Apple ID. If the first request returns `202`,
continue with the 2FA request.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1/login \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"username":"you@example.com","password":"your-app-specific-password"}'
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1/login/2fa \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"code":"123456"}'
```

Check the current session or clear the in-memory login state:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1/me
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1/login
```

### arm64-v8a image (Apple Silicon / AArch64 Linux)

Stage **arm64-v8a** Android system binaries and Apple Music native libraries,
then build a **linux/arm64** image so `wrapper`, the NDK daemon, and the staged
`linker64` / `.so` set share the same ABI.

The Docker **compile** stage is always **linux/amd64** (Google ships the Linux NDK as an
x86_64-host ZIP only). The image then cross-compiles `wrapper` for AArch64 when
`TARGET_ARCH=arm64-v8a`. Set **runtime** platform to arm64; `BUILD_PLATFORM` in Compose is
ignored but kept for compatibility.

Extract and stage the arm64 files:

```bash
bash tools/extract-libs.sh --bundle path/to/local/apple-music.apk --arch arm64-v8a
bash tools/stage-system.sh --arch arm64-v8a
```

Or use a local `.apkm` bundle:

```bash
bash tools/extract-libs.sh --bundle path/to/local/apple-music.apkm --arch arm64-v8a
bash tools/stage-system.sh --arch arm64-v8a
```

Build the arm64 image:

```bash
TARGET_ARCH=arm64-v8a RUNTIME_PLATFORM=linux/arm64 \
  docker compose up --build
```

On an **x86_64** host, `docker compose` / `docker run` need **QEMU** (binfmt) to run a
`linux/arm64` container. On an **arm64** host, run the image **natively** (no emulation).

### Daemon configuration

The daemon reads `WRAPPER_*` environment variables (forwarded via
`compose.yaml`). See `.env.example` for the full list. The most useful are:

- `WRAPPER_HOST`, `WRAPPER_PORT` - public HTTP bind address and port.
- `WRAPPER_DECRYPT_HOST`, `WRAPPER_DECRYPT_PORT` - raw TCP decrypt bind address
  and port. Defaults are `0.0.0.0` and `10020`.
- `WRAPPER_MODE` - internal C++ worker mode. Normal users should not set it;
  the Rust supervisor sets `ipc-worker` automatically.
- `WRAPPER_WORKER_TIMEOUT_SECS` - timeout for one IPC request to the C++
  Apple worker. Default is `60`.
- `WRAPPER_BASE_DIR` - filesystem dir Apple's libs use for the FPS
  key cache and `mpl_db`. The default matches upstream wrapper.
- `WRAPPER_RESTORE_SESSION` - set to `0` to skip startup token harvest from
  an existing on-disk Apple session (default is restore on).
- `WRAPPER_APPLE_ID` - optional display label for `apple_id` in `GET /me` after
  session restore only (not sent to Apple).
- `WRAPPER_DEVICE_INFO` - 9-tuple identifying the fake Apple Music
  Android client. Same fingerprint upstream uses by default.
- `WRAPPER_APPLE_INIT=0` - skip Apple lib initialization at startup.
  Lets you bring up the HTTP server alone for `/health` smoke tests
  even on builds where you have not staged the Apple libraries yet.
- `WRAPPER_USERNAME` + `WRAPPER_PASSWORD` - if both are set and the runtime
  initialized, the daemon runs password sign-in at startup when not already
  authenticated (same semantics as `POST /login`; 2FA still needs
  `POST /login/2fa`). Treat these as secrets.

### CI build

The `.github/workflows/build.yml` workflow runs on **push** to `main`,
on **pull_request** (same-repo only for the full job), and **workflow_dispatch**.
It uses the same host steps as above plus a Docker build and `/health` smoke
test, with one repository secret:

- `APK_URL` - private/local CI URL for a compatible Apple Music `.apk` or
  `.apkm`. The artifact is downloaded inside CI only, extracted with
  `tools/extract-libs.sh`, and is not committed.

**Matrix:** both `x86_64` and `arm64-v8a` jobs use `ubuntu-latest`. The arm64 image is
`linux/arm64` at runtime; QEMU is enabled before the smoke `docker run` so the job works
on amd64 GitHub runners. The compile stage stays **linux/amd64** for the official NDK ZIP.
The job also runs `cargo test`, validates `compose.yaml`, and checks that the
TCP decrypt listener accepts connections.

Pull requests opened from forks skip the build job because they cannot read the
secret.

## Troubleshooting

### `curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 80`

The container started but its ports aren't exposed to your host. Check:

```bash
docker ps
```

The `PORTS` column should show `0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp`. If it's blank:

- **Colima users:** The port forwarding sometimes doesn't take on first start after a fresh `colima start`. Stop and remove the container, then start it again:

  ```bash
  docker stop wrappr && docker rm wrappr
  docker compose up -d
  docker ps
  ```

- **Port 80 already in use:** Another process or container has port 80. Either stop that, or override the port:

  ```bash
  HTTP_PORT=8080 docker compose up -d
  curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
  ```

- **Old container still registered:** Run `docker ps -a` to check for stopped containers still holding the port, and `docker rm <name>` to remove them.

### `auth: cached-session restore found Apple session files but token harvest failed`

This shows up in `docker logs wrappr` and just means the saved Apple session on disk couldn't be refreshed automatically. The daemon is still running fine — you just need to log in again:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1/login \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"username":"you@example.com","password":"your-app-specific-password"}'
```

If your account uses two-factor authentication, you'll get a `202` back. Follow it with:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1/login/2fa \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"code":"123456"}'
```

### `ERROR: rootfs/system/bin/linker64 is missing`

You skipped `stage-system.sh`. Run it before building:

```bash
bash tools/stage-system.sh --arch x86_64
docker compose up --build -d
```

### `ERROR: rootfs/system/lib64/ has no .so files`

You haven't extracted the Apple Music libraries yet. Run `extract-libs.sh` with your APK path:

```bash
bash tools/extract-libs.sh --bundle /path/to/apple-music.apk --arch x86_64
docker compose up --build -d
```

### `playback_ready: false` in `/health` or `/me`

The Apple native worker loaded but FPS isn't ready. Usually means the Apple Music libraries didn't initialize correctly — check `docker logs wrappr` for error lines from the `wrapper-v2` process. Most common cause is a library version mismatch (wrong APK build).

### Saving your session across container rebuilds

The `./data` directory in your clone is mounted into the container at
`/app/rootfs/data/data/com.apple.android.music/files`. As long as that directory
exists and you don't wipe it, your Apple session survives rebuilds and restarts.
To back it up:

```bash
cp -r ./data ./data-backup
```
